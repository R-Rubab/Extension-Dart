#Inheritance
inheritance in Dart is a key feature of object-oriented programming that allows a class
(known as a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class
(known as a superclass or base class). This enables code reusability and establishes a
natural hierarchy between classes.

#Key Concepts of Inheritance in Dart

1.Superclass and Subclass:

2. Superclass base parent : The class whose properties and methods are inherited.

3. Subclass derived: The class that inherits properties and methods from the superclass.

4. extends Keyword: In Dart, the extends keyword is used to indicate that one class is inheriting from another class.

5. > Access to Superclass Members: The subclass can access public and protected properties and methods of the superclass.

   > Private members (declared with a leading underscore) are not accessible outside the file they are declared in.

6. Overriding Methods: Subclasses canoverride methods of the superclass to provide specific

7. Overriding Methods: Subclasses can override methods of the superclass to provide specific implementations using the @overrideannotation.

8. Constructors: Constructors of the superclass are not inherited by the subclass, but the subclass call the superclass constructor using the super keyword.
